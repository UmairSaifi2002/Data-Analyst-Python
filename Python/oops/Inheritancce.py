# Absolutely, Umair! 💡
# Let’s go step by step — **just like a teacher in a computer lab**, with clear **concepts**, **code examples**, and **real-world analogies** so you understand **everything** about **Inheritance in Python**. 🧠💻

# ---

# ## 🧠 **1. What is Inheritance?**

# **Definition:**
# Inheritance allows a class (**child/derived class**) to inherit the **properties** and **methods** from another class (**parent/base class**).

# ### 📌 Why use inheritance?

# * Code reusability
# * Avoid duplication
# * Maintain a hierarchy
# * Add/extend functionality without rewriting base code

# ---

# ## 👪 **2. Real-Life Analogy:**

# Think of a **parent-child relationship**:

# * Parent: Has qualities like eyes, name, language, etc.
# * Child: Automatically inherits these features, and may add new ones.

# In programming:

# ```python
class Parent:
    def speak(self):
        print("I can speak!")

class Child(Parent):  # Inheriting from Parent
    def dance(self):
        print("I can dance!")

c = Child()
c.speak()   # From Parent
c.dance()   # From Child
# ```

# ---

# ## 🧱 **3. Types of Inheritance in Python**

# ### 🔹 1. **Single Inheritance**

# One child inherits from one parent.

# ```python
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("Animal makes sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def bark(self):
        print("Dog barks")

d = Dog()
d.sound()  # From Animal
d.bark()   # From Dog
# ```

# ---

# ### 🔹 2. **Multilevel Inheritance**

# A child inherits from a class, and another class inherits from that child.

# ```python
class Grandfather:
    def land(self):
        print("I have land")

class Father(Grandfather):
    def house(self):
        print("I have house")

class Son(Father):
    def car(self):
        print("I have a car")

s = Son()
s.land()   # From Grandfather
s.house()  # From Father
s.car()    # From Son
# ```

# ---

# ### 🔹 3. **Multiple Inheritance**

# A class inherits from multiple parents.

# ```python
class Mother:
    def cook(self):
        print("Cooking")

class Father:
    def earn(self):
        print("Earning")

class Child(Mother, Father):
    def play(self):
        print("Playing")

c = Child()
c.cook()
c.earn()
c.play()
# ```

# ---

# ### 🔹 4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**

# Multiple child classes inherit from the same parent.

# ```python
class Vehicle:
    def move(self):
        print("Can move")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def drive(self):
        print("Driving car")

class Bike(Vehicle):
    def ride(self):
        print("Riding bike")

c = Car()
c.move()
c.drive()

b = Bike()
b.move()
b.ride()
# ```

# ---

# ### 🔹 5. **Hybrid Inheritance**

# A mix of multiple inheritance types. This becomes tricky and Python uses **MRO (Method Resolution Order)** to resolve conflicts.

# ```python
class A:
    def func(self):
        print("A")

class B(A):
    pass

class C(A):
    def func(self):
        print("C")

class D(B, C):  # Hybrid
    pass

d = D()
d.func()  # Output? Uses MRO to decide
# ```

# ---

# ## 🔧 **4. Key Concepts and Tools in Inheritance**

# ### 🟡 Method Overriding

# Child class redefines the method of parent class.

# ```python
class Parent:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from Parent")

class Child(Parent):
    def greet(self):  # Overrides Parent's method
        print("Hello from Child")

c = Child()
c.greet()
# ```

# ---

# ### 🟡 `super()` Keyword

# Used to call the parent’s constructor or methods in the child.

# ```python
class Parent:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Parent constructor")

class Child(Parent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()  # Calls Parent's __init__()
        print("Child constructor")

c = Child()
# ```

# ---

# ### 🟡 Constructor Overriding

# If a child has its own `__init__()`, it overrides the parent’s constructor unless `super()` is used.

# ---

# ### 🟡 Method Resolution Order (MRO)

# In multiple inheritance, Python looks for methods **left to right** in the class declaration.

# ```python
class A:
    def show(self):
        print("A")

class B(A):
    def show(self):
        print("B")

class C(A):
    pass

class D(B, C):
    pass

d = D()
d.show()  # Output: B, because D → B → C → A
# ```

# To view the MRO:

# ```python
print(D.mro())
# ```

# | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
# | `class Child(Parent)`  | Inherits all methods and properties from `Parent`                   |
# | `super()`              | Calls the parent class method/constructor                           |
# | Method Overriding      | Redefining a method in the child class                              |
# | Constructor Overriding | Redefining `__init__()` in the child class                          |
# | MRO                    | The order in which classes are searched during multiple inheritance |
